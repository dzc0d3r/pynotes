# pyNotes :snake:
A place where you can master Python and enjoying the journey while doing so.

## Brief Introduction
Before diving into learning python, let's talk about the main motivation behind this repository and why Python ?


Python has become one of the most loved and popular programming languages in the world in recent  years. It's used in everything from artificial intelligence and machine learning to data analysis to web develepoment to building desktop applications to software testing and even building mobile applications. The choice of making it your first programming language to learn is very appealing and convenient, As a matter a fact it's the Most Popular Introductory Teaching Language at Top ­U.S. ­Universities.

I decided to make this repository as part of my learning journey, as a beginner i have faced many challenges and obstacles, especially the lack of professional well documented arabic resources, the tutorial hell, not learning the right way, not knownig what i'm learning and why, not learning by doing and getting my hands dirty, not thinking as programmer..etc I thought of a way to help me as well the others whom facing the same challenges.


## What you will learn
We will try to cover everything you need to become a successful pythoneer, starting from the very basics of python to building a really strong portfolio to showcase what you got under your belt.
